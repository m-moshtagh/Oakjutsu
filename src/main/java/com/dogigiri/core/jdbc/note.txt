# Data source is a way for clients to obtain a DBMS connection. Apache dbcp, Hikaricp, TomcatCp. we define a bunch of
parameters like driverClassName, URL, username, password etc.

# Data source points to connection pool. obtaining a database connection is an expensive job, so we'll have some free
connections in the pool so the clients can take them and release them.

# WE also add flyway for database migration.

# We use JDBC template instead of raw JDBC

# We use java.sql & javax.sql packages for JDBC API

# JDBC API has two parts: 1- API used by programmers 2- JDBC Driver which is low level configuration to connect to DB.

# JDBC driver types: JDBC Driver is an implementation of JDBC API interfaces for a specific DB.
1- JDBC-ODBC driver
2- Java + native code driver
3- All java + middleware translation driver
4- All java driver

# Steps to write a Data access class:
1- import packages
2- Set a JDBC driver (optional since java6 and JDBC 4.0)
3- Open a Connection
4- create a statement
5- execute
6- close resources

# we have statement and preparedStatement interfaces to run queries.

# We also have batch transactions.
1- establish a Connection
2- Create statement
3- add SQL command using addBatch()
4- execute batch using executeBatch()

# We use setAutoCommit false to disable Transactions.
