# Switch Expressions
This feature added to Java in version 13. We can now return expressions alongside statements in switch block and
store the result in a variable.
To use this feature we use -> instead of : in front of case keyword.
If we have multiple expressions for a case, we can use yield keyword in order to break the switch.
