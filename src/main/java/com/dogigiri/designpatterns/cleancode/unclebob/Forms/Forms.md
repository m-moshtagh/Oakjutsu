### Coding Standards

The Code itself should be the coding standard. everything should be understandable inside the code.

Comments should be rare. They should be where for real programmers need to read it.

> In modern languages "Every Comment is a Failure".

Examples of Good comments:

* Copyright comments
* regex or string foramat explanation
* todo comments
* legal rights
* public api comments

Good code can also make top choices useless.
