## Functions
***
### Functions Rule No.1
Functions should be small, 4 lines is ok and of course We need long highly descriptive names for our functions.
Old good point says that function should do only one thing. in order to achieve that we continue extracting that 
function until we cannot extract it anymore.(extract till you drop)
